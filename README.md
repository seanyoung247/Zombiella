# UX

## User Goals
* An entertaining story that keeps interested running
* A familiar story, but with unusual twist and endings
* An obvious Halloween theme

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to navigate through the story efficiently
* As a user, I want to have different options to proceed through the story
* As a user, I want to have appropriate animations visible
* As a user, I want to have clear instructions on when to interact
* As a user, I want to know when the story has finished
* As a user, I want to be able to restart the story

## User Requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
* Clear instruction when an interaction is required
* Clear instruction on how to interact
* Animations that are relevant
* Screen displays to be different for each part of the story
* Visual prompt to know when an option has been selected
* Ability to reread the story after completion
* Quality content that relates to the original story
* No long paragraphs, text to be created in short sections

### Expectations
* I expect to know the title of the story
* I expect to know when to interact with the story
* I expect to know when the story is over
* I expect to be entertained
* I expect to have clear definition between parts of the story


## Site owners Goals
* Single page layout with clear text displayed
* Depict a Halloween story with a dramatic twist
* Ensure the story can be interacted with in some way
* Include animated elements

## Strategy
### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made

&nbsp;

### Strategy Description
|Item Description | Importance Score | Feasibility Score | Outcome |
| --------------- | ----------| -----------| ----------|
| Ensure the story can be interacted with in some way |5 | 5 |10 |
| Include appropriate animated elements |5 | 5 |10 |
| Ability to restart the story | 4 | 5 |8 |
| Clear instructions on when to interact |5 | 5 |10 |
| Obvious Halloween theme |5 | 5 |10 |
| Displayed on a single screen | 2 | 5 | 7 |

# Wireframes
To develop the wireframes, we have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)

The wire frames can be viewed below.

## Design Choices
### Fonts
We have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to select suitable fonts for the story. In 2011, google released a Haloween range of fonts and we have decided to go for [Creepster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Creepster?query=cree&preview.text=Zombiella&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles "Creepster") for the headings and logo. For the main text within the story, we decided with [Arvo 400](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?query=arvo&preview.text=Once%20upon%20a%20time......&preview.text_type=custom "Arvo") as it compliments Creepster and gives an old storybook look to the text.


### Colours
Initially, we began looking for a colour pallet using [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/halloween "colorhunt") and searched using Halloween as a key work. From this, we converted the key colours into [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/ "Colourmind"), then completed the rest of the pallet. 

![Final Colour Pallet](readme-images/colour-pallet/colour-pallet-final.jpg)

These colours give great flexibility as there is the possibility of several combinations of text and background colour that pass the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM") tests. The results can be seen below.

* White text with black background - [link](readme-images/colour-pallet/colour-pallet-white-black.jpg "Link")
* White text with purple background - [link](readme-images/colour-pallet/colour-pallet-white-purple.jpg "Link")
* White text with red background - [link](readme-images/colour-pallet/colour-pallet-white-red.jpg "Link")
* Orange text with black background - [link](readme-images/colour-pallet/colour-pallet-orange-black.jpg "Link")


### Images



### Breakpoints
Our breakpoints will be based on the [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap"). We may not necessarily be requiring all of these, but if breakpoints are needed, they will be at these points.

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

### Structure
The structure of this project has been mapped out using [Lucid](https://lucid.co/ "Lucid").

Creating the flow, allowed us to create a basic outline of the story in order to develop the content.

# Features

## Existing Features

* **Header**: shows the title of the story and when clicked the page reloads, this allows the user to start the story again.

* **Navigation bar**: it allows the user to navigate through the story by providing the correct buttons to carry on with the story. It is composed by a "next" button, "read again" button, and two buttons that allow the user to make a choice when required.

* **Scene area**: area where the user can see the animation of the story.

* **Footer**: it contains the link to the Github and LinkedIn profiles of all the developers that worked on the project.

&nbsp;

## Features to be Implemented

* Implement more paths the user can go through when having to choose what Cinderella's options, so the reading experience is completely different everytime you read it.

* Implement more interaction with the graphics, so the user will be able to click on an element and this would be animated.

* The users can enter their name when starting the story so it is more personalised and they get more involved in it.

* Creating an application using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/)

# Dev-Log

## Andrew Dempsey

This Hackathon was a very enjoyable experience. I had the opportunity to work with a team of super talented and motivated coders. The 'Spookatooners' worked great together by keeping each other motivated, lending a helping hand when needed & giving feedback as well as suggestions on each other's work. We all learned a great deal about working together as a team, planning and managing tasks within a large project as well as learning valuable new technical skills. The best parts of the experience were producing an excellent end product, making new friends and of course, having fun!

## Ana Genover

I have highly enjoyed participating in this hackaton. It is fantastic to have had the opportunity to work on a project with other students, learn together, be supportive to each other and, most importantly have fun. Overall it is been a great experience, this is my first hackaton and I will surely register for the next one.
